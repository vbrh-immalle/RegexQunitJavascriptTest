# RegexQunitJavascriptTest

This repository demonstrates:

- regular expressions (in Javascript)
- unit testing (with the QUnit testing framework from JQuery)

This branch (`exercise`) contains a **TODO** with a small explanation. Try to make all tests **green**!
(You can check for solutions in the `master`-branch. Other solutions might be correct as well. Please report any bugs you might encounter in the tests!)
